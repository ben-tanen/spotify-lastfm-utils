## Spotify and Last.fm utilities

A collection of scripts for interfacing with Spotify and Last.FM

Some of these scripts are for pulling data from these services, some of them are for automating my music ecosystem, some are for experiments. They're all works in progress (read that as not to be used by others).

Current scripts include:

- A script for checking if a song appears in any of current playlists. This was a tool I used when making playlist for [my college radio show](http://link.ben-tanen.com/papaT/) to avoid repeated plays of a song.
- A script to identify my recent top played songs and save them in a Spotify playlist that I keep saved on my phone. A useful tool for keeping some of my favorite songs available when I'm out of cell range.
- A script for scraping my top artists on a weekly (or monthly period). This data is for a post on my website (link to come).
- A script to explore algorithmically generated "clustered playlist." This was an experiement that I wrote about for my website (link to come).
